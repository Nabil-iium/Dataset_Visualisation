# Dataset_Visualisation
In this project I have taken the sentiment140 dataset. It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the twitter api. The tweets have been labeled (0 = negative, 4 = positive). 
Here I have shown tokenization, vectorization on tweets. For visualising the most frequent words on the datase, I have used WordCloud. I have also shown both the positive and negative labeled tweets words which are the most frequent in the dataset.
This is a simple visualisation of the words from the dataset.
